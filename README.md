Sync script between google sheets and gcal for The Cast

This is probably useful as an  example for others. This Apps Script pushes events from a google sheets document into a specific google calendar. 

[The Cast](thecastmusic.com) uses this to track rehearsals and performances in a shared calendar. The spreadsheet can contain lots of other information that isn't necessarily pushed into the calendar, and can be used for other operations too. For example, we base our internal pay calculations on the spreadsheet.
